          Marth is a Marth. One time he died for two years then came back and made a discord server. He now forces me to program random crap, such as this website. For some reason he wanted me to make the website as physically crappy as possible. Thanks Marth. He is also a funny man with lots of original jokes. Always laugh at his jokes or else he will become depressed. If you want to make him laugh, just repeat one of his original jokes back to him. If you forget the joke, that's ok, just tell him a small part you remember and he will still laugh. The end.

          Luke, is a very handsome young dapper man. He is big brain and nerdy because when he sees something IRL (In Real Life) he mentally thinks "man I want to program that." He also likes Starwars, cookie cake, and ramen. He is also very good at video games but hates all of the games he plays. He could be rank 1 NA in league of legends but complains about spggeti code and rng. He also likes the Dominos pan pizza after a good ol' game of american football.

He is a coder (formerly) and works with boop boop robots (formerly?). He plays lots of games like League of Legends, Apex, and DnD. Hes pretty good at said video games.He always knows how to put a smile on peoples faces, and although he may not show it we all know he has a humongous heart. He is an overall kind person and hes like the brother none of us had and we all love and appreciate him dearly.

          The individual known as Raini has not many appealing features besides being affectionate towards Jonathan. The history of her is limited due to the factor of not sharing much information about herself, and only really interacting within the community if Jonathan is here as well, or wants to know about Jonathan. Raini's known features are as follows.

1. Raini loves Jonathan.
2. Raini has a mother who is known as Miss Weather.
3. Raini has a dick that changes sizes between 2-20 inches.
4. Raini wants Jonathan to physically hurt her for pleasure.
5. Raini goes to robotics.
6. Raini shares most features of a basic white girl.
7. Raini has seen Jonathan's body. All of it.
8. Raini is short.
9. Raini is hyperintelligent unless it comes to video games.
10. Raini loves being called Rain or Weather.

There would be more, but not many other features that I could include about Raini, but in all I'd rate 9/11. Come back next for my review on whatever the fuck Marth tells me to review.

          Liam is a person of maybe the male gender. Him and Sarah are in a homosexual relationship. He plays League of Legends, Deep Rock Galactic, sometimes Apex Legends, and an assortment of other games. Liam is easy-going and makes everyone feel included! While sometimes he zones out and becomes quiet, he is very good at leading a team and helping teach new players on new games. DM.
